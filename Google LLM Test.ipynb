The value of the threshold can be changed \\nand  reduced to show a high accuracy \\nresult in the fraudulent transaction detection, but the classifying legal \\ntransactions as fraudulent will increase. For example, detect many fraudulent transactions? or reduce false \\nwarnings? And so on during the variation between the values of recall and \\naccuracy, for example, note that \\nthe value of the accuracy exceeds the value of the recall at threshold 5, in contrast to the threshold at 0.7. \\nThe previous variation is not possible if the logistic regression is used to build a fraud detection model. \\nAuto\\nencoder network does not need to use the data balance methods to achieve the model unlike logistic \\nregression that needs to balance data before the construction of the model.\\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\nConclusions and Recommendations\\n \\n \\n \\nWith the large and ongoing financial loss currently being experienced by financial companies, It was \\nnecessary to develop more efficient methods on which the electronic systems to detect fraudulent \\ntransactions, fraud detection is a very difficult and comp\\nlex task.

Financial \\nauthorities, in response, have recommended that we enhance exis ting Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) of banks and other \\nfinancial institutions. FDSs are systems designed to prevent e- finance accidents through real-time access and validity checks on \\nclient transactions. The effectiveness of an FDS depends largel y on how fast it can analyze and detect abnormalities in large \\na m o u n t s  o f  c u s t o m e r  t r a n s a c t i o n  d a t a .  I n  t h i s  s t u d y  w e  d e t e c t  f raudulent transaction patterns and establish detection rules th rough \\ne-finance accident data analyses. Abnormalities are flagged by comparing individual client transaction patterns with client \\nprofiles, using the ruleset. We propose an effective flagging m ethod that uses decision trees to normalize detection rules. In  \\ndemonstration, we extracted cust o m e r  u s a g e  p a t t e r n s ,  c u s t o m e r  p rofile informations and detection rules from the e-finance \\naccident data of an actual domestic(Korean) bank. We then compa red the results of our decision tree-normalized detection rules  \\nwith the results of a sequential detection and confirmed the ef ficiency of our methods.\\nKeywords: Fraud Detection System, Banking System, e-finance accident, Dec ision Tree, Normalization\\n 2) \\n접수일(2014년 11월 17일), 수정일(1차: 2014년 12월 29일,\\n2차: 2015년 1월 21일), 게재확정일( 2015년 2월 4일)3)\\n†주저자, tabrisme@gmail.com \\n‡교신저자, ejkim777@kgu.ac.kr(Corresponding author)', metadata={'page': 0, 'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHEIJF0C9rz2AZEcZ1hC0kWqv1WyxCn5/view', 'title': '의사결정나무를 이용한 이상금융거래 탐지 정규화 방법에 관한 연구.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Al\\n-\\nShabi\\n; \\nJAMCS\\n, \\n33(5): 1\\n-\\n16, 2019\\n; Article no.\\nJAMCS\\n.\\n51106\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16\\n \\n \\n \\n[14]\\n \\nChawla\\n \\nNV\\n, Bowyer\\n \\nKW\\n, Hall\\n \\nLO\\n, Philip\\n \\nKPW.\\n \\nSMOTE: \\nSyntheti\\nc \\nminority over\\n-\\nsampling \\ntechnique.
